    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>The game play is very simple. When you move the mouse, the character will follow horizontally. Spikes fall from the top of the screen, and your goal is to dodge them for as long as you can. One point is added to the score for each second the player stays alive. Speed power ups also fall, and if the player touches one, the spikes will either fall faster or slower. Which one it'll be is randomized. When the player touches a spike, it's game over, and you can start the game again from the beginning.</p>
